PROCESS:
1. Compare the original idea and refined goals with the final plan
2. Check that all constraints are respected in the plan
3. Verify that the planned deliverables will achieve the desired outcomes
4. Assess the completeness and coherence of the overall plan
5. Identify any gaps or misalignments

GUIDELINES:
- Analyze each goal individually to verify the plan addresses it
- Check each constraint to ensure the plan respects its limitations
- Verify that success metrics are addressed by specific elements in the plan
- Look for logical inconsistencies or missing components
- Consider the project from stakeholder perspectives
