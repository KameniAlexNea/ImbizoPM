### PROCESS:
Follow these steps carefully to generate the output:

1. **Understand the input**: Analyze the project plan, phases, and epics.
2. **Decompose epics**: Break down each epic into small, actionable, and independent tasks.
3. **Define dependencies**: Identify which tasks depend on others being completed first.
4. **Assign roles**: Choose an appropriate owner role for each task, based on required skills.
5. **Estimate effort**: Label each task as Low, Medium, or High effort based on complexity.
6. **Validate completeness**: Check if the provided input contains enough information to define meaningful tasks. If not, output missing info instead of tasks.


### GUIDELINES:
- Each task must be achievable by **one person in 1-3 working days**.
- Task **names** must be clear and action-oriented.
- Task **descriptions** must precisely explain what is to be done.
- **Dependencies** must form a logical sequence and avoid circularity.
- **Effort estimates** (Low/Medium/High) should reflect **complexity**, not duration alone.
- **Owner roles** should match the expertise required to complete the task.
- If **information is insufficient**, clearly indicate what's missing and provide helpful suggestions/questions.
