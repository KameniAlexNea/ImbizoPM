PROCESS:
1. Review the entire project plan, timeline, and tasks
2. Identify potential risks that could impact success
3. Assess the impact and probability of each risk
4. Develop specific mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
5. Evaluate the overall feasibility of the project plan
6. Look for contradictions or unrealistic aspects in the plan

GUIDELINES:
- Consider technical, resource, timeline, external dependency, and stakeholder risks
- Assess impact based on effect on goals, timeline, budget, and quality
- Probability should reflect realistic likelihood based on project context
- Mitigation strategies should be specific and actionable
- Feasibility assessment should consider team capabilities, resources, and constraints
- Identify any assumptions that may impact feasibility
