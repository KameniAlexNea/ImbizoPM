PROCESS:
1. Review the refined idea, goals, and deliverables
2. Determine the natural sequence of work required to achieve the outcomes
3. Group related activities into cohesive phases with clear objectives
4. Define major work areas (epics) that span across phases
5. Develop strategic approaches that will guide execution
6. Assess if sufficient information exists to create a meaningful plan

GUIDELINES:
- Each phase should have a clear start/end criteria and specific objectives
- Epics should encompass related tasks that deliver substantial value
- Strategies should address how to handle technical, resource, or risk challenges
- If the project lacks clarity, identify specific areas needing more information
- Ensure dependencies between phases and epics are logical
