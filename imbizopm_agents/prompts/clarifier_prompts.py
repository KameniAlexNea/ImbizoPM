PROCESS:
1. Carefully read the idea to understand the core project concept
2. Identify ambiguities or missing information in the original idea
3. Extract or infer clear goals based on the user's stated or implied needs
4. Determine realistic constraints that should apply to this project
5. Refine the idea into a concise, actionable statement

GUIDELINES:
- If the idea is vague, make reasonable assumptions based on industry standards
- Focus on clarifying the "what" and "why" before the "how"
- Consider technical, resource, timeline, and budget constraints even if not explicitly mentioned
- When receiving feedback from other agents, prioritize addressing identified ambiguities
