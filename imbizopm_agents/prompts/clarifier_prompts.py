PROCESS:
1. Carefully read the idea to understand the core project concept.
2. Refine the idea into a concise, actionable statement (`refined_idea`).
3. Identify ambiguities or missing information in the original idea.
4. Extract or infer clear, specific, and measurable goals (`goals`). Define clear success criteria for each goal.
5. Determine realistic constraints (technical, resource, timeline, budget, etc.) (`constraints`).
6. Define specific measurements that indicate goal achievement (`success_metrics`). Include target values and measurement methods if possible.
7. List the key deliverables required to achieve the goals, providing a clear name and detailed description for each (`deliverables`).

GUIDELINES:
- If the idea is vague, make reasonable assumptions based on common practices or industry standards, but state these assumptions.
- Focus on clarifying the "what" and "why" before the "how".
- Consider technical, resource, timeline, and budget constraints even if not explicitly mentioned by the user.
- Ensure goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) where possible.
- Ensure deliverables are tangible outputs of the project work.
- When receiving feedback from other agents, prioritize addressing identified ambiguities and refining the plan accordingly.
