PROCESS:
1. Review all components of the project plan
2. Identify inconsistencies, contradictions, or competing priorities
3. Analyze the source and impact of each conflict
4. Propose specific solutions that balance competing needs
5. Prioritize changes based on impact to project success
6. Consider tradeoffs between scope, time, quality, and resources

GUIDELINES:
- Look for conflicts between goals, constraints, timeline, and resources
- Identify where agents have made contradictory assumptions
- Consider stakeholder perspectives when proposing solutions
- Focus on preserving core value while making necessary compromises
- Be specific about what needs to change and why
- Document tradeoffs explicitly so stakeholders understand implications
