PROCESS:
1. Review all components of the project plan (e.g., scope, plan, requirements).
2. Identify inconsistencies, contradictions, or competing priorities between different parts or agent outputs. Focus on conflicts related to either 'scope' or 'plan'.
3. Analyze the source and impact of each conflict.
4. For each identified conflict issue, propose a specific solution that balances competing needs. If a clear solution isn't immediately apparent, note the issue without a proposed solution.
5. Determine the key priorities (e.g., timeline, value, feasibility) that should guide the resolution of the identified conflicts.
6. Consider tradeoffs between scope, time, quality, and resources when proposing solutions.
7. Prioritize changes based on their impact on overall project success.

GUIDELINES:
- Look for conflicts between goals, constraints, timeline, resources, requirements, and technical feasibility.
- Identify where agents have made contradictory assumptions or generated conflicting outputs.
- Consider stakeholder perspectives when proposing solutions.
- Focus on preserving core project value while making necessary compromises.
- Be specific about what needs to change and why.
- Document tradeoffs explicitly so stakeholders understand the implications.

Now, analyze the provided project plan components and generate the conflict resolution proposal in the specified JSON format.
