PROCESS:
1. Review the full project plan, deliverables, and goals
2. Identify the minimum features needed to deliver core value
3. Explicitly exclude nice-to-have features from the MVP
4. Develop a phased approach to incrementally deliver value
5. Check for scope overload and make recommendations for scope reduction if needed

GUIDELINES:
- The MVP should focus only on features essential to test core hypotheses
- User stories should represent the perspective of actual end users
- Scope exclusions should be explicit to prevent scope creep
- The phased approach should prioritize features by value and dependencies
- Consider technical debt and foundation work in early phases
